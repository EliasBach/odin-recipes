        <li>Cook Time: 5 mins</li>

        <li>Total Time: 45 mins</li>
        <li>Servings: 2</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound large raw shrimp (16-20 count), peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mild-flavored honey</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon freshly grated ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Asian fish sauce, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup thinly sliced green onion, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure shrimp are fully thawed and well drained. Keep in the refrigerator while you make the marinade.</li>
        <li>Whisk garlic, honey, ginger, soy sauce, and fish sauce together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add shrimp and toss thoroughly with a spatula for 2 minutes until completely coated.
            Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 to 60 minutes; toss occasionally while marinating.</li>
        <li>Brush a large nonstick skillet with oil and heat over high heat until you begin to see small wisps of smoke. 
            Use tongs to immediately transfer shrimp into the hot skillet in a single layer. Set excess marinade aside.</li>
        <li>Sear shrimp for 2 minutes, then flip over. Dump in marinade and cook for 1 minute. Turn off heat and flip shrimp once more; let sit for about 1 minute. 
            The marinade in the pan will reduce down to a beautiful glaze just from the residual heat in the pan. Garnish with green onion.</li>
    </ol>
